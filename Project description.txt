Problem: Write a linked list program that would accept two sets of character entries.  
	Entry for each list should only terminate when the ESCAPE key is pressed.  
	The program should arrange and display the entries in each list in ascending order.  
	The program should then merge the two lists, still in ascending order, and should only 
	make one pass through each list during the merging process.  The program should accept 
	duplicate entries and should not accept non-alphabet entries.

Resolution scale, and layout should be at 100% (preferably);
Java version: 18.0.2;
Terminates the entry for each linked list with ESCAPE key;
Press ENTER to submit entry (just like a console);
